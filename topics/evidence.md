# Who says? 
Ways to provide evidence and justification for declaring a site unreliable.

## Merge and purge

The more fake-new lists that include a site, the more likley that site is fake news. (Caveat: some lists have identical sources.) The Unreliable News Sites (UNS) index at CJR merges five lists.

Add these databases (merge then purge inactive sites):
* Is It Fake News?


## Links to list pages
We'll link to the following pages for each site (if one exists):
* Factual News Search (if site has results)
* Fake News Codex 
* Media Bias/Fact Check (if tagged Qustionable Source, Conspriacy/Pseudoscience, Left or Right Bias)
* Wikipedia

- [ ] Harvest Wikipedia website pages from Wikipedia's <a href="">List of fake news websites</a>, OpenSources notes, and the Is It Fake News? database (site now offline).

## Links to fact-checker pages
We'll also link to any fact-checking pages for unreliable sites at:
* FactCheck.org
* Lead Stories
* MBFC (get site's levels for Conspiracy and Pseudoscience)
* PolitiFact
* Snopes
* Truth or Fiction

- [ ] Harvest tags/categories at fact-check sites (via WP REST API; wget for PF) then add archive URLs for any that match indexed sites.



## Tags
- [ ] Add tags for sites (if any) from:
* MetaCert (via their API)
