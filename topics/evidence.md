# Who says? 
Ways to provide evidence and justification for declaring a site unreliable.

## Merge and purge

The more fake-new lists that include a site, the more likley that site is fake news. (Caveat: some lists have identical sources.) The Unreliable News Sites (UNS) index at CJR merges five lists (then purges inactive sites).

## Links to list pages
We'll link to the following pages for each site (if one exists):
* Factual News Search (if site has results)
* Fake News Codex 
* Media Bias/Fact Check (if tagged Qustionable Source, Conspriacy/Pseudoscience, Left or Right Bias)
* Wikipedia

We'll harvest Wikipedia website pages from Wikipedia's <a href="">List of fake news websites</a>, OpenSources notes, and the Is It Fake News? database.

## Tags
Add tags for sites (if any) from:
* MetaCert (via their API)
